        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish 
        featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions,
        bell pepper, and garlic. It's usually eaten for breakfast,
        but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner, served with lots
        of bread to mop up the sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingrdients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers, any color</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 hot chile pepper, seeded and finely chopped, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 large</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, 
                bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until vegetables have softened
                and onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix together tomatoes, chile pepper, cumin, paprika,
                and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir tomato mixture into onion mixture. Simmer, uncovered, until
                tomato juices have cooked off, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make 4 indentations in tomato mixture; crack eggs into indentations. 
                Cover the skillet and cook until eggs are firm but not dry, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>       
        </ol>
