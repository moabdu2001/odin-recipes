    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish 
       featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions,
       bell pepper, and garlic. It's usually eaten for breakfast,
       but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner, served with lots
       of bread to mop up the sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingrdients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers, any color</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste</li>
